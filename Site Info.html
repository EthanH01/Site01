      <h3>This Site! ðŸ“–</h3>

    <p>This is a portfolio created by myself as a project for the Catapult Program.</p>

    </div>

    <div class = "two rightSide">

      <h3>I created a virtual wireframe, showcasing basic functionality and features.</h3>

    <p>The wireframe (displayed) is very close to the final product, placement on images wise. </p>

    <div class = "three leftSide">

      <h3>Original Plan!</h3>

    <p>I intended on creating a more animated and interactive site, however I didn't get to it.</p>

  </div>

    <div class = "four rightSide">
      
      <h3>Code</h3>

    <p>This portfolio demonstrates relatively basic code, but is truly a steppng stone into bigger projects. Whilst I didn't entirely excel in every aspect of the Catapult Program, I intend on improving soon. </p>

      <h3>Future Plans</h3>

    <p>I plan on updating this site very often - adding more and more as my skills advance. </p>
